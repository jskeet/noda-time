Noda Time is an alternative date and time API for .NET. It helps you to
think about your data more clearly, and express operations on that data more
precisely.

The `NodaTime.Testing` package is designed to work with the
`NodaTime` package, providing fakes for `IClock` and time zones, as
well as extension methods to construct values for tests in a fluent
manner.

See the project web site at https://nodatime.org for more details.
