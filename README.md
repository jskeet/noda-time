Noda Time is an alternative date and time API for .NET. It helps you to
think about your data more clearly, and express operations on that data more
precisely.

Most enquiries about the project are best 

* [Project web site](http://nodatime.org) - for documentation, installation, downloads etc
* [Group/mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/noda-time) - for discussion of potential features 
* [Project source and issue site](https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime)
* [Stack Overflow tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nodatime) - for specific "How do I do X?" questions

The above links should be used for most interactions. The Gitter chat linked below is also available,
but as Noda Time is a small project, there are rarely people actively watching the chat - most concerns
are better handled on Stack Overflow, the mailing list, or as a GitHub issue.
