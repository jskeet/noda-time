# Explicitly build the two biggest projects separately; just dnx
# test would work, but separating out the build step makes for
# simpler diagnostics. We run the smaller test suites first, to
# give earlier confirmation that they're working at all.
# (NodaTime.Test can time out easily...)
# Note that we don't currently run the TzdbCompiler tests, as that
# fails on Mono in understandable ways - it's really designed to
# run on Windows, given that it relies on Windows BCL TimeZoneInfo
# to check mappings.
