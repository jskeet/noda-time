# This script is designed to be run on a scheduled basis, to build and deploy the web site
# in an automated manner. It takes the following steps, with input as a
# "web site build root directory" (henceforth known as $root).
#
# - Find the latest commit for the main repo
# - If $root/$commit exists, assume there have been no changes, and abort
# - Make a shallow clone (--depth 1) of the main repo to $root/$commit/nodatime
# - Make a shallow clone (--depth 1) of the nodatime.org repo to $root/$commit/nodatime.org
# - Run $root/$commit/build/buildweb.sh $root/$commit/nodatime.org
# - In $root/$commit/nodatime.org
#   - Create a new commit
#   - Push to nodatime.org repo
